## Packages for running the code
To run the code you need to install:

**CasADi**: https://web.casadi.org/

**HSL Solver**: https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/coin-hsl

Note: Installing the HSL package can be a bit comprehensive, but the solvers just speed up the solutions. You can comment out the places where the HSL solver is used, i.e., options.ipopt.linear_solver = 'ma57', and just use the default linear solver of CasADi.

## Introduction to the files
The article includes three case studies. The implementation details of the code are given below.

In the folder **case_1_change_homotopy_iteration_n**:

(1) The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrackInitialization.m` defines the optimization problem for initializing the homotopic optimization.

(2) The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrack.m` defines the optimization problem during the homotopy iterations.

(3) The file `parameters_define.m` defines the static parameters.

(4) The files `main_1.m` to `main_11.m` contain the cases for implementing the homotopic optimization with different iterations $n$. For example, in `main_1.m`, $n=120$. The only difference in these files is just different values of $n$.

(5) To implement the method, first run `parameters_define.m`, then you can choose any case from `main_1.m` to `main_11.m` to get the results with different $n$ values.

In the folder **case_2_different_road_velocity_conditions**:

(1) The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrackInitialization.m` defines the optimization problem for initializing the homotopic optimization.

(2) The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrack.m` defines the optimization problem during the homotopy iterations.

(3) The files `parameters_define_D.m`, `parameters_define_W.m`, and `parameters_define_S.m` define the static parameters on the dry, wet, and snow roads, respectively. The files `parameters_define_H.m`, `parameters_define_M.m`, and `parameters_define_L.m` define the static parameters with high initial speed, middle initial speed, and low initial speed, respectively.

(4) The files `main_D.m`... `main_L.m` implement the homotopic optimization method corresponding to the parameters defined in `parameters_define_D.m`...`parameters_define_L.m`. For example, `main_D.m` implements the problem subject to the dry road with the static parameters defined in `parameters_define_D.m`.

(5) To implement the method, first run the file `parameters_define_X.m` to define the parameters, then run the main file `main_X.m`. 

In the folder **case_3_compare_with_stepwise_initialization**:

(1) It contains three sub-folders, corresponding to the implementation of the stepwise initialization for the three problems listed in Table III of the paper.

(2) For instance, in the sub-folder **problem 1**, the implementation of Problem 1 in Table III of the paper by the stepwise initialization is provided, where the file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrackInitialization.m` defines the optimization problem for initializing the optimization. The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrack.m` defines the optimization problem for solving the maneuvering problem, where the initial guess is obtained stepwisely. The file `parameters_define.m` defines the static parameters, and `main.m` is the main file for running the method. Normally, the stepwise initialization does not get convergence for this problem. The files in another two sub-folders are interpreted in the same way.

(3) To implement the method, first run `parameters_define.m`, then run `main.m`.

In the folder **case_4_compare_with_driver_model_initialization**:
(1) It contains three sub-folders, corresponding to the implementation of the driver-model-based initialization for the three problems listed in Table III of the paper.

(2) For instance, in the sub-folder **problem 1**, the implementation of Problem 1 in Table III of the paper by the driver-model-based initialization is provided. The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrack.m` defines the optimization problem for solving the maneuvering problem, where the initial guess is obtained by the driver model. The file `parameters_define.m` defines the static parameters, and `main.m` is the main file for running the method. The files `SplinePath.m`, `generate_circle_points.m`, and `DriverModel.m` together find the initial guess of the problem by the driver model. Normally, the driver-model-based initialization does not get convergence for this problem. The files in another two sub-folders are interpreted in the same way.

(3) To implement the method, first run `parameters_define.m`, then run `main.m`.
