## Packages for running the code
To run the code you need to install:

**CasADi**: https://web.casadi.org/

**HSL Solver**: https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/coin-hsl

Note: Installing the HSL package can be a bit comprehensive, but the solvers just speed up the solutions. You can comment out the places where the HSL solver is used, i.e., options.ipopt.linear_solver = 'ma57', and just use the default linear solver of CasADi.

## Introduction to the files
The article includes three case studies. For the convenience of the reviewers during the peer-review process, we provide the code for the first case study, which involves adjusting the homotopy iterations $n$ in the optimization problem. The full implementation will be published if the paper is accepted.

The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrackInitialization.m` defines the optimization problem for initializing the homotopic optimization.

The file `MinTimeCoGDoubleTrack.m` defines the optimization problem during the homotopy iterations.

The file `parameters_define.m` defines the static parameters.

The files `main_1.m` to `main_11.m` contain the cases for implementing the homotopic optimization with different iterations $n$. For example, in `main_1.m`, $n=120$. The only difference in these files is just different values of $n$.

To implement the method, first run `parameters_define.m`, then you can choose any case from `main_1.m` to `main_11.m` to get the results with different $n$ values.
